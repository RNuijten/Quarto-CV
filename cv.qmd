### **About Me**

<span style="color:#555555;">Over 5 years experience in drone-based remote sensing, machine learning and data fusion for the assessment and management of forest ecosystems. Produced related best practices guides and science that continues to be operationalized. Has instructed and created materials for students in post-secondary education related to geospatial data analysis and data science.</span>
