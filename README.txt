README for Rik's CV template 

I would like to acknowldge Cynthia A Huang for creating the initial Quarto CV template (https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/). 
Furthermore, the icons that can be found in the pdf version of the CV are from:
-- academicons (https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)
-- iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)

The rendering of the html/pdf files was performed using weasyprint, which requires the following software installations:
-- weasyprint (installation instructions here: https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/v52.5/install.html#windows)
-- weasytools (R installation command: devtools::install_github('RLesur/weasydoc'))
